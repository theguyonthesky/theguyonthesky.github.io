I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Colorado State University (CSU), advised by Professor [Indrakshi Ray](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~iray/), specializing in cybersecurity. As a member of [Ray's Cyber Lab](https://rayscyberlab.org/), I am currently in the phase of exploring various aspects of security to shape my long-term research direction. My primary research interests involve system security, network security, threat detection, and incident response. Recently, I have worked on projects related to firmware security and Android inter-process communication (IPC) security, particularly using the Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) model.

Prior to beginning my Ph.D. program, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the University of Central Florida (UCF). I then completed my Master of Science in Cybersecurity at UCF, where I had the opportunity to explore the more practical aspects of security through hands-on projects and coursework.

After completing my Master's, I had the opportunity to work as an instructor, teaching a cybersecurity course at Western Caspian University. In addition to my academic experience, I also worked as a Security Analyst at Duskbeacon, where I applied my skills to proactively defend systems and networks.

I have strong hands-on experience in the defensive side of cybersecurity, with particular expertise in email security, network security, SIEM, endpoint security (EDR), threat detection, and incident response. I am actively engaged with various defensive tools and technologies in this space.

For a broader view of my experience and the tools I specialize in, you can access my [resume](/files/Elmaddin_Azizli_Resume.pdf), and for a closer look at my work, feel free to explore my [GitHub](https://github.com/theguyonthesky), where Iâ€™ve shared several security-related projects. Please note that you may also come across non-security-related projects which reflect my broader interests and what I enjoy working on in my free time.

Speaking of my free time, when I don't dive into projects, I mainly spend my time reading books about psychology and philosophy. I also enjoy playing chess and working out.
